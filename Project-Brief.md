## 🔄 HOW TO USE THIS FILE

### For New Projects:

1. **Copy this template** to your project repo
2. **Rename** to `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
3. **Fill out all sections** (use "N/A" if truly not applicable)
4. **Review with client** for accuracy
5. **Update as project evolves** (this is a living document)
6. **Reference constantly** during development

### For Cursor AI:

This file works WITH `CURSOR_GLOBAL.md`:
- **CURSOR_GLOBAL** = Universal technical standards (same for all projects)
- **PROJECT_BRIEF** = Client-specific context (unique per project)

Cursor will read BOTH files to understand:
- HOW to build (from GLOBAL)
- WHAT to build (from BRIEF)

### Update Frequency:

- **Daily:** During active development if scope changes
- **Weekly:** During design/planning phase
- **As Needed:** When client provides new info/assets
- **Post-Launch:** Update with actual metrics and learnings
